# Brief Analysis of Biodiversity in four United States National Parks
In this project I explore two datasets that contain information about various species observed in the four U.S. National Parks:
Yellowstone, Yosemite, Bryce, Great Smoky Mountains and investigate patterns in conservation statuses of various species.
In particular, I focus on the following themes:
* How often are different species observed in US parks?
* What is the distribution of conservation statuses among different categories of animals?
* Distribution of species in each park
* How often are mountain lions (cougars) observed in each park?
